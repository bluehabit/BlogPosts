### Autoprefixer

Some newly introduces css properties (such as Flexbox and CSS transitions) don't have build-in standardized support across different browsers, and some properties have different implementations. To address this, vendor prefixes were added to these properties.  These prefixes let a browser render its own version of a certain property until its standardized.
