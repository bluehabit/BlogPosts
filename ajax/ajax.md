Ajax Calls

•	XMLHttpRequest Object 
•	Fetch API
Can use the XHR object in JS to communicate with a server to send /receive data, the response from the server can be received without refreshing the page. XHR is the underlying technology that allows for 'single page' applications like gmail. 
The older, but most supported cross-browser solution is to use the XHR object to make an AJAX call, otherwise you can make Ajax calls with jquery
XMLHttpRequest Object onreadystatechange
 
Or
XMLHttpRequest 2.0 Event Handlers
 
Using the Newer fetch API
