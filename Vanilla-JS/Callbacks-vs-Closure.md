# Callbacks and Closures

In JavaScript, if you declare a function within another function, then the local variables can remain accessible after returning from the function you called. A function inside another function always creates a closure around variables in the outer scope. However, that closure only outlives the outer scope if the inner function escapes. Remember, when you `return` it exits the function and whatever is at the end of `return` is what the function spits back out. You must **return the function itself** for it to be a closure. Lets take a look at an example:

```
function myCity(cityName){
	var cityName = cityName;
	var state = 'texas';
	return printCity(cityName);
	//NOT a closure, have to return function itself

	function printCity(city){
		return 'I live in ' + city + ' within the state of ' + state; 
	}
}

```

This is not a closure. `return printCity(cityName)` is just calling the function like normal, but you are returning it. In the line `return printCity(cityName)` remember `return` just spits out what comes after it, in this case its just a normal functon call `printCity(cityName)`. If you want to turn this into a closure you would need to **return the function itself**. 

Within the `higherOrder` function you are explicitly passing the parameters (like `houseNum`, `street`, etc.) to the `callback function`.

This is similar to invoking regular functions with arguments/parameters. On the other hand, closures are invoked after their host/parent function is completely executed.

## Nested Functions

## Example 1

Example of *nested* functions, but not a closure.

## Example 2

Lets explore how to make the previous example a closure.

![example-2](http://imgur.com/95YX2FN.png)


![example-3](http://imgur.com/e97f3nf.png)

The `return` keyword always **exits** the function. In this case, the `return` keyword is within the lexical scope of the parent function, `function1`, as a result it ends the whole function. 

## Notice What happens... 

When we remove the `return function2` line. It throws an error.

## Example 3

Examine the scope, closure section of dev tools.

Lets walk this through step by step.

1. the function `test()` runs and it `returns` another function, in this case just the function definition. Remember whatever comes directly after the `return` keyword is the output of the function, and the function will also exit. So it is literally returning what is after the keyword return:

```
  return function() {
    console.log(value);
  };
```
2. This is why we must do `test()()`. `test()` is just holding the function definition described above. So if its holing a function definition, we must call it with `test()()`. 

3. This is a `closure` because we already exited the function with the `return` keyword using `return function(){console.log(value)}`. But notice how we have access to the parent functions scope variable `value`.  


Here, we just call the function `test()`. Within that functions lexical scope it has `return function()`, thus thats what we get back out of the function. Look below `console.log(value)`. Because `return` exits the function and gives us something back. The anonymous function has access to its parent function and its variables, in this case `value`.

### Tricky Examples

Can verify using chrome dev tools that a function is actually a closure.

## Example 9

This is also an example of closure.

![img](http://imgur.com/injrehz.png)

Here `return` exits the function, whatever comes at the end of `return` is what the output of the funciton is. In this case what comes after `return`we have `say` which is just the function definition as we can see below.

Understand how a reference to a function is returned to a variable `(say2)` in the above code. Note `say` is a variable which holds an `anonymous function` e.g. `function(){console.log(text)}` 

## Example 10

All three global functions have a common reference to the same closure because they are all declared within a single call to `setupSomeGlobals()`.

The three functions have shared access to the same closure â€” the local variables of `setupSomeGlobals()` when the three functions were defined.

Note that in the above example, if you call `setupSomeGlobals()` again, then a new closure (stack-frame!) is created. The old `logNumber`, `increaseNumber`, `setNumber` variables are overwritten with new functions that have the new closure. (In JavaScript, whenever you declare a function inside another function, the inside function(s) is/are recreated again each time the outside function is called.)
