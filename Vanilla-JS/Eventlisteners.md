## SASS

Variables make our code much easier to maintain, and less cumbersome to update. For instance, let's say we had a large CSS file where we wanted to update all instances of the color of `pink` to `#ee1786` for all the different components on the site. To do this by hand could be tedious.
Instead, using a CSS preprocessor we can declare a variable and have all of our components reference this exact color. Now we only have to update it in one spot and it will propagate throughout the whole page.
